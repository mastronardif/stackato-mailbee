<P>Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireConstantOnLeftSideOfEquality - Putting the constant value on the left side of an equality exposes typos.

<P>This Policy is part of the core <A HREF="../../../../Perl/Critic.html">Perl::Critic</A>
distribution.

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>This policy warns you if you put a constant value (i.e. a literal number or
some string) on the right side of a <CODE>==</CODE> operator when there is a variable or
some other lvalue on the left side.  In a nutshell:

</P>
<PRE>  if($foo == 42){}    # not ok
  if(42 == $foo){}    # ok

  if($foo eq 'bar'){} # not ok
  if('bar' eq $foo){} # ok</PRE>

<P>The rationale is that sometimes you might mistype <CODE>=</CODE> instead of <CODE>==</CODE>, and
if you're in the habit of putting the constant value on the left side of the
equality, then Perl will give you a compile-time warning.  Perhaps this is
best explained with an example:

</P>
<PRE>  if ($foo == 42){}  # This is what I want it to do.
  if ($foo = 42){}   # But suppose this is what I actually type.
  if (42 = $foo){}   # If I had (mis)typed it like this, then Perl gives a warning.
  if (42 == $foo){}  # So this is what I should have attempted to type.</PRE>

<P>So this Policy doesn't actually tell you if you've mistyped <CODE>=</CODE> instead of
<CODE>==</CODE>.  Rather, it encourages you to write your expressions in a certain way
so that Perl can warn you when you mistyped it.

</P>
<P>The <CODE>eq</CODE> operator is not prone to the same type of typo as the <CODE>==</CODE>
operator, but this Policy still treats it the same way.  Therefore, the rule
is consistently applied to all equality operators, which helps you to get into
the habit of writing compliant expressions faster.
